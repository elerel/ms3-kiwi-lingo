## User Experience

### Project Description

The aim behind Kiwi Lingo is to form an online dictionary/phrase reference guide to various words and phrases spoken in New Zealand. 

Each word or phrase in the dictionary will have a definition, a phonetic spelling to aid the pronunciation and an example of how the word or phrase is commonly spoken by locals.

Kiwi Lingo would be typically used for:

- First time visitors to New Zealand
- Visitors currently in New Zealand struggling to understand the locals
- Visitors or locals looking to brush up on their slang or use as a reference guide to teach others
- New Zealanders that would like to add their own words or phrases to help visitors to NZ
- People that have visited NZ that would like to keep a log of phrases/words/slang encountered on their visit

Visitors to the site will be able to sign up for an account so they can easily add any words or phrases to the dictionary that might be missing. They can also search for words or phrases in the search tool bar.

### User Stories

#### First Time User Stories
##### As a first time user:
-  I want to be able to fully understand the reasoning behind the site.
-  I want to be able to navigate easily throughout the site.
-  I want to be able to search for words and phrases commonly spoken in New Zealand.
-  I want to be able to set up my own account and add my own additions to the site.
-  I want to be able to view popular sayings and phrases by viewing the most liked/disliked additions.


#### Registered User Stories
##### As a regular user:

- I want to be able to contact the site owners.


#### Site Owner User Stories

- To provide information on the site and who it is intended for.
- To allow the site to be accessible (viewing only) without creating an account.
- To be easily contacted should the user lose their log-in details.
- To allow users to only edit or delete their own additions.
- To be able to delete any inappopriate content added by a registered user.

### Overview

New Zealand English and their own slang can be quite hard to grasp if you're a first time visitor to New Zealand or in conversation with a Kiwi in a loud pub. Sometimes it can seem like Kiwi English is an entirely separate language! Which is why I decided to have a go in creating an online guide to some of the most common New Zealand phrases and lingo. Kiwi slang can be found just about anywhere, even in the likes of fancy restaurants and hotels. It includes some Maori phrases and Maori slang used in everyday life.

This app is designed as a complete guide on New Zealand slang and how to use it like a real Kiwi!  The phrases or words may look complicated but trust me once you get the hang of it, itâ€™s easy as bro.





 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
