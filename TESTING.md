## **Validation**

To ensure the site had correct code syntax, it was validated using [W3 MarkUp Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

HTML Validation:

To resolve, I simply replaced the "section" with a "div" and no further errors were found:

## Performance

Using Google Chrome's DevTools, these Lighthouse scores are based on the opening page of the site, being viewed on desktop and mobile devices. The lowest score (performance) was mainly due to the loading time of the first carousel image which could be addressed or better formatted at a later stage:

Desktop Score:
